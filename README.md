* As you can see from above, the average temperatures in June and December are quite close, June is 74.9, which only about 4 degrees higher than December, at 71. 

* December's coldest temperature was 56, which is more like fall or spring for a lot of other cities. It is still not bad for ice cream lovers. 

* December's warm day temperature 83, is quite close to June's warm day 85. This is a good temperature for ice cream as well.  

## Summary: 

It is a good idea to open the Surf and ice cream shop business in Oahu as the difference for winter and summer is quite small, and winter is quite warm.
